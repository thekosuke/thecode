            <p>
              italiaDesign is an 8-month field school program offered by Simon Fraser University, where 
              students research and experience Italy’s rich design culture. We interviewed emerging 
              and established Italian designers which then became a short film series. italiaDesign field 
              school is ran bi-annually with a team of 12 students directed by Russell Taylor.

              Within our 8-month study, we spent 2-months in Italy immersing ourselves in the 
              country’s history and culture. We traveled between Rome, Milan, Florence, Bologna, 
              Liguria, and a day trip to Switzerland after visiting the Alessi factory. During 
              our time in Milan, we got to interview emerging and established Italian designers 
              - ranging from graphic design, type design, industrial design, and digital design. 
              Getting exposure to different disciplines have broadened my point of view on 
              design and deepened my interest in the practice.

              After our trip to Italy, we produced a series of short films and made a website to present 
              them. I designed the website with 2 of my peers, while taking the lead to build the 
              site. I played an essential role in the entire development of the website - from design 
              direction, storytelling, user experience, visual design, and web development.

            <p>                    
              We were able to share our interviews and a fraction of our experience through the website, 
              but the entire 8-month program in itself was a very personal experience for each of us.  
              <br><br>
              I enjoyed the weekly presentations and discussions we had in the first four months. We 
              showed up every Friday to share research on Italian art and design history. We learned 
              their food culture and other nuances that we wouldn't have learned on our own. We also 
              took an Italian course as a team to learn the basics. Learning a new language is very 
              hard, much respect to those who have.
              <br><br>
              The feeling of being in Italy after studying it in-depth on our laptops was unparalleled. 
              Because we had done the research, we were able to appreciate the history and respect 
              the culture throughout our trip. Though it's not just the in-field study - living and 
              working with my peers for two months was a valuable experience that inspired self-reflection.              
              <br><br>  
              In hindsight, I view this as my graduate project. We spent four months researching a 
              subject and immersed ourselves in a foreign environment with that knowledge. We got to interact 
              with local people and learn how design fits inside a particular context. The website was our 
              opportunity to share what we learned from the past six months and have it documented like a time capsule.

            <p>
              Touchpoint Interaction Design Conference is a part of Simon Fraser University and the School 
              of Interactive Art and Technology. Touchpoint is ran annually with each year having its own 
              visual identity for their website. I volunteered to design and develop the brand and website 
              for Touchpoint 2019 as a fun project.

              I designed and developed mobile-first considering that people will visit the site on their 
              phones to view the guest speakers. I wanted the site to act as a digital handbook for those 
              attending the conference. And quite honestly, I find it much easier to build responsiveness 
              mobile-first.

            <p>             
              The driving concept of the user experience was <b>'Function & Play'</b>―to design a function-first 
              web experience with playful moments that engage the audience. One of the additional requirements 
              for the 2019 site was to include guest bios, so I went with an accordion UI to store and show the 
              content without crowding the small screen.

              The navigation bar was placed at the bottom of the phone screen with consideration to ergonomics, 
              so people can access the menu with ease when holding the phone with one hand. Dark mode was 
              implemented since I thought a dark interface could be desirable in a dim conference room. 
              Dark mode also introduced a new color scheme that became a pleasant surprise for the audience. 
              It was well received at the conference so it was a proud moment for me as an early-career designer. 
              Dark mode before it was cool.

              The first impression sets the tone for the rest of the experience, whether that's meeting 
              someone or entering a building. I believe this applies to visiting a website as well. On 
              landing, I took a moment to engage the audience while leaning on the Play side of the experience.
