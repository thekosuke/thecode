              <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>
                <a href="https://www.remotion.com/" target="_blank">Remotion</a> is a virtual office that makes 
                room for casual conversations with coworking and shared music. It is a macOS app that lets you 
                pin your teammates to the dock to have background awareness of what people are up to. 
                <br><br>
                I was brought in as a product designer in the Core Experience team to make focused improvements 
                to the core app. The team consisted of 5 engineers and myself, with the goal to increase retention 
                and word of mouth sharing.

              <h3>Roadmap</h3>
              <p>
                The Core Experience Team's roadmap was driven by the most critical problems that 
                led to user churn. Thus our goal was to hit the "Beta Bar" — a lower quality bar 
                that we’re willing to accept as we’re in a period of rapid iteration. Even in this 
                state, we need to provide an experience that’s good enough where a user likes our 
                product enough to want to share it with others.
                <br><br>
                We focused on solving problems within the core workflows before investing in brand 
                new features that drive new user value (which would be GA).

              <p>
                The led design for two projects: Dock & Availability and Coworking with Music. 
                Both workflows had critical problems that led to user churn and were not meeting 
                the Beta Bar. 
              </p>

              <h3>Primary Workflows of the Dock</h3>
              <p>
                The focus of the project was to address the problems with the main workflows that 
                lead to user churn. We intentionally avoided re-imaginining the dock and 
                app model overall, invest in brand new workflows and features that drive new user 
                value, and convince users who are anti-dock to use our app. It was more about 
                getting Remotion users who is okay with using the dock to love the dock.            
              </p>  

              <div id="myImg" class="projectImage">
                <img src="img/work/remotion/dock/remotion-4.png" onclick="onClick(this)">
              </div>
                    
              <h3>Prioritized Problems</h3>
              <p>
                We learned that users have the dock minimized or hidden 59% of the time. This was 
                because users had to choose between having a large dock with all their teammates 
                or unpinning people. Users who don’t use the dock rely on under-developed surfaces 
                like the mini dock, or overflow popovers.
              </p> 
             
              <div class="projectImage">
                <img src="img/work/remotion/dock/remotion-5.png" onclick="onClick(this)">
              </div>

              <h3>Solution</h3>
              <p>
                The final design led to giving users more control, introducing dynamic contents 
                in the dock, and clarifying status and availability. I also simplified the overall 
                architecture by consolidating overlapping surfaces.
              </p> 

              <div class="projectImage">
                <img src="img/work/remotion/dock/remotion-6.png" onclick="onClick(this)">
              </div>

              <h3>My Process</h3>
              <p>
                This is a peak into my design process. I explore numerous solutions on Figma while 
                articulating my intent behind each decision. Writing helps me organize my thoughts 
                while zooming in and out of the problem. By sharing the document with the team, 
                it keeps the team aligned and understand where my head is at.

                </video>
               </div>

              <h3>User Archetypes</h3>
              <p>
                As I continued to get feedback from teammates in different roles, I noticed a disconnect 
                between what managers and ICs want in their dock. This made me question how the dock 
                should be populated and how to prioritize items for different use cases. I asked what 
                their current dock looks like and what their ideal dock would look like if we were to 
                introduce the new model in order to consider different perspectives.
              </p>

                <img src="img/work/remotion/dock/remotion-8.png" onclick="onClick(this)">
              </div>

              <h3>Dynamic Contents</h3>
              <p>
                Auto-populate contents in the dock based on the user’s favorites, teammate’s availability, and recent activity.

                Rethinking the pinning model so people don’t have to unpin teammates
                People were hesitant to unpin people because the UX around unpinned teammates were underdeveloped and was a hassle to access.
              </p>

                </video>
               </div>

              <h3>Give Users More Control</h3>
              <p>
                Enable users to customize the contents in their dock by giving fine tuned control over the number of certain items.

                What people want on their dock is very subjective to each individual so we wanted Remotion to allow people to customize their dock
              </p>
              <div class="projectImage">
                <img src="img/work/remotion/dock/remotion-10.png" onclick="onClick(this)">
              </div>

              <h3>Clarify Status & Availability</h3>
              <p>
                Simplify and clarify
                The most important information is whether someone is free to call or not
              </p>
              <div class="projectImage">
                <img src="img/work/remotion/dock/remotion-11.png" onclick="onClick(this)">
              </div>

              <p>
                In response to the small dock getting busy, I stripped the dock to the essentials when set to Small. 
                The most essential status is whether the person is available or not. Users can learn what others 
                are up to via Tool Popover. By doing so, we reduce visual clutter and create breathing room for the avatars.
