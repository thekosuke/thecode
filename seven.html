            <h4>Background</h4>
            <p>
              After my experience at Macro, I sought to work at a company with a 
              consumer-facing product where I could collaborate in cross-functional 
              teams. My main priorities were to learn and work alongside other 
              designers while working towards a mission that I can get behind.
              <br><br>
              This led me to join <a href="https://www.seven.me/" target="_blank">Seven.me</a>—a 
              health-focused startup building a system of products and services that make health 
              mastery accessible to all through behavioral health coaching. As their third designer, 
              I was given the opportunity to lead design projects from start to finish, owning 
              the discovery, ideation, and delivery, in collaboration with cross-functional 
              stakeholders (Product, Research, Copywriting, and Engineering).
            </p>                                 
          </section>

          <section id="section2">           
            <h4>Reflection Activities</h4> 
            <p>
              My main assignment was to own the end-to-end experience of what we considered 
              to be lifestyle prescriptions. These are in-app activities that our behavioral 
              health coaches prescribe to the clients as a way to develop the right mindset 
              to sustain healthy habits.
            </p>  
            <div class="project-image">
              <img src="img/work/seven/seven-1.png">                           
            </div>
            <p>
              I was responsible for building this experience from scratch as I created a brief 
              to get everyone on the same page and led a brainstorming session with cross-functional 
              team members to generate diverging concepts. From here, I synthesized the values 
              and created a framework that should be consistent among all activities.
              <br><br>
              This enabled us to divide the experience into three stages and identify how we 
              can deliver value in different stages. I established foundational value pillars
              that act as the DNA of all reflection activities in order to design a cohesive 
              set of activities.
            </p>

            <h5>Wheel of Life</h5> 
            <p>
              Among these reflection activities, Wheel of Life was a key component of Seven’s 
              coaching—a tool for clients to assess different aspects of their life to identify 
              a focus area to improve on. This activity was initially done on paper, so we 
              translated this into a digital experience that clients can complete inside the app.
            </p>  
            <div class="project-image">
              <img src="img/work/seven/seven-3.png">                           
            </div>  
            <p>
              The product development process started with Product, Behavioral Health, and Design 
              identifying the client and coach needs. Based on these discoveries, I explored different 
              directions and pieced together elements that best aligned with our research findings.
              <br><br>
              This process led to us narrow down the user experience into two potential paths. 
              One was focused on practicality, and the other was an experimentation on dynamic 
              interactions. We developed a research plan to conduct A/B testing for these two flows 
              so we can validate the hypotheses we formed. 20 participants went through this study 
              and we learned that there were different aspects of the two flows that resonated with people.
            </p>  
            <div class="project-image">
              <img src="img/work/seven/seven-4.png">                           
            </div>                       
            <p>
              The final design aims to guide clients through each area of life by zooming in and 
              out of the wheel. This was done by starting with an overview of the wheel and allowing 
              clients to tap into each area to set their score. 
              <br><br>
              Many users neglected the description of each area, so I chose to have the score 
              card fill up half of the screen upon appearance to present one item at a time. 
              By doing so, the half-view afforded browsing different areas while the full-view 
              enabled scoring. 
            </p>

      				</video>
        		</div>  
            <p>
              <br><br>
              As our product and brand was at a very early stage, our goal was to build an 
              experience that delivers the essential values. Thus it was important that these 
              14 different activities follow a similar UI pattern that prioritize scalability.              
              <br><br>
              For activities that require a response from the clients, we encouraged clients to 
              speak out loud so they can internalize the positives. Hearing yourself talk is 
              known to be good practice in coaching/therapy sessions, and our clients 
              expressed that they appreciated this detail.

            <h4>UX/UI Improvements</h4>
            <p>
              On the side, I continuously made UX/UI improvements to the Client app since the existing 
              implementation was essentially a wireframe. This includes the registration flow, 
              scheduling coaching sessions, and the Account page. To maximize design and engineering efficiency, 
              I developed a <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/p9V3XKKTz6sHFrUe7eC8tH/Short-term-Design-System?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">short-term design system</a> 
              by creating reusable components in a monochromatic color scheme that is flexible for 
              future brand development.

            <h4>Graphic Design</h4>
            <p>
              In addition to product design work, I spend time on graphic design work including the pitch deck, 
              service visualizations, product concepts, marketing materials, and internal materials.

            <h5>Launchpad</h5>      
            <p>
              Launchpad was a starter kit that gets delivered to our clients in the beginning of 
              the coaching program to help them establish the right mindset before starting their 
              journey. I was responsible for visualizing various concepts for prototyping purposes.

              I made to visually tell the client stories from our pilot program. 
              Since this was made for internal use only, I was given full creative
