              <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>
                <a href="https://www.seven.me/" target="_blank">Seven</a> is a health-focused startup 
                building a system of products and services that make health mastery accessible to 
                all through behavioral health coaching.
                <br><br>
                As their third designer, I led design for Seven’s digital offerings by owning the 
                end-to-end experience of multiple projects while collaborating with cross-functional 
                stakeholders. My main responsibilities were to revamp the client-facing mobile app 
                while improving the internal web platform and the company website.

              <h3>Reflection Activities</h3>
              <p>
                Reflection Activities are in-app activities that behavioral health coaches prescribe to help 
                clients develop the right mindset to sustain healthy habits.
                <br><br>
                When I joined Seven, there was no digital component to this. The activities were simply HTML 
                pages that gave clients instructions on what to do. There were 16 activities that had to be 
                translated into an in-app experience so this required me to build a systemized design from scratch. 
              </p>    

              <div class="projectImage">
                <img src="img/work/seven/seven-2.png" onclick="onClick(this)">
                <p class="caption"><i>Before/After of Reflection Activities</i></p>
              </div>  

              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>
                The purpose of Reflection Activities was to help clients gain deeper self-awareness and develop 
                self-efficacy through various content and activities provided by the coaches. In order to 
                successfully deliver value through these activities, it was important to approach the problems 
                from both, clients and coaches perspective.
                <br><br>
                The existing implementation was a simple HTML which didn’t provide a UI for users to interact 
                with. This stagnant experience affected the credibility/trustability of the platform, which 
                ultimately led to poor coaching outcomes. It also failed to contextualize the prompt and 
                provide guidance for clients to get the most out of their activities.
              </p>  

              <div class="projectImage"></div>     
              
              <h3>Framing</h3>
              <p>
                In order to address these problems, I established four fundamental pillars that act as the 
                DNA of all Reflection Activities: <br><br>
                1. Credibility of the activity, Getting buy-in from the clients<br>
                2. Managing expectations, Establishing the right mindset <br>
                3. Personalized value, Constructing meaning <br>
                4. Ongoing practice, Habit building
                <br><br>
                These pillars were then slotted into three different stages of the experience to identify 
                the best point of the experience to inject value: Pre-Activity, In-Activity, and Post-Activity. 
                Each pillar was framed with a question to inspire the explorations.
              </p>

                <p class="caption"><i>Proposed Framework</i></p>
              </div>    

              <h3>Systemized Design</h3>
              <p>
                With 16 different activities that follow a similar structure, breaking it down into three 
                stages helped clarify how we might develop a reusable pattern across all activities. Each 
                stage had its own UI pattern that enabled us to plug in content in a flexible manner. The 
                short-term <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/p9V3XKKTz6sHFrUe7eC8tH/Short-term-Design-System?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">design system</a> 
                I created helped make the process for design and engineering more efficient in order to tackle the flows in parallel.

              <h3>Wheel of Life</h3>
              <p>
                Among these reflection activities, Wheel of Life was a key component of Seven’s coaching—a tool 
                for clients to assess different aspects of their life to identify a focus area to improve on. 
                This activity was initially done on paper, so we translated this into a digital experience that 
                clients can complete inside the app.
                <br><br>
                The product development process started with Product, Behavioral Health, and Design identifying 
                the client and coach needs. Based on these discoveries, I explored different directions and 
                pieced together elements that best aligned with our research findings.
              </p>

              </div> 
              
              <p>
                This process led to us narrow down the user experience into two potential paths. One was focused 
                on practicality, and the other was an experimentation on dynamic interactions. We developed a 
                research plan to conduct A/B testing for these two flows so we can validate the hypotheses we 
                formed. 20 participants went through this study and we learned that there were different aspects 
                of the two flows that resonated with people.
              </p>

              </div> 

              <p>
                The final design aims to guide clients through each area of life by zooming in and out of the 
                wheel. This was done by starting with an overview of the wheel and allowing clients to tap into 
                each area to set their score.
                <br><br>
                Many users neglected the description of each area, so I chose to have the score card fill up 
                half of the screen upon appearance to present one item at a time. By doing so, the half-view 
                afforded browsing different areas while the full-view enabled scoring.                              
              </p>

              <p>
                On the side, I continuously made UX/UI improvements to the Client app since the existing 
                implementation was essentially a wireframe. This includes the registration flow, scheduling flow, 
                and the Account page. Since our product was premature and we prioritized function, I went with a 
                monochromatic color scheme that was flexible for future brand development.
