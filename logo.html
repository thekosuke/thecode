            <h1>Macro (2020)</h1>
            <p>
              Designing the <a href="/macro">Macro</a> logo was something I was super excited about. I appproach logos as 
              something personal to founders, since it represents their vision. Naturally, I started 
              my process by learning what Macro meant to them. Their story and the thought they had 
              put into the company was referenced throughout my process.
            </p>

            <div class="projectImage">
              <img src="img/work/logo/logo-1.png" onclick="onClick(this)">
            </div>

            <p>
              The logo stands for what Macro—the company, product and team—aspires to become, not what 
              it is today. The aspiration was to become an accessible pro tool that offers a more humane
              way for people to work with technology. In essence, we wanted people to focus on work that 
              requires empathy.
            </p>

            <div class="projectImage">                
              <img src="img/work/logo/logo-2.png" onclick="onClick(this)">
            </div>

            <p>
              With respect to this ideology, I wanted the logo to look and feel modern, robust, 
              and familiar. I believed these were qualities that reflected what an "accessible pro tool" 
              would have. Avante Garde was used for the logotype, also used for the corporate logo of 
              Adidas and is one of the main typefaces in Sony’s corporate marketing programs. The 
              modernist typeface that is already used in ubiquitous brands helped convey a 
              sense of boldness, progression, and profession.

            <h1>Touchpoint 2019</h1>
            <p>
              I volunteered to design and develop the brand and website for <a href="/web">Touchpoint 2019</a> 
              as a fun project.
              <br><br>
              I formed my point of view on what the 2019 site should look like by first looking into 
              past Touchpoint websites. Based on the constraints and the patterns I saw, I wished to 
              introduce a playful identity that reinterprets an idea from the past.               
            </p>

            </div>

            <p>         
              As a design direction, I saw an opportunity in the origin of modern design: the Bauhaus. 
              A movement that taught art's relationship to society and technology, while understanding 
              design as something that should be accessible to all.
              <br><br>     
              I chased for a visual identity that represent the playful attitude I wished to express. 
              After some exploration, I landed with a familiar yet obscure form that allowed for numerous 
              interpretations. With a signature motion sequence, I established a visual language that 
              became a foundation of the identity.

            </div>

            <p>
              When choosing a typeface, the concept and form of Avenir Next aligned with our goal to 
              reinterpret an idea from the past in a modern context. Avenir represents the transition 
              of a period in typography as Frutiger aimed to hint aesthetics of the 21st century. 
              Frutiger's ambition to foreshow the future was something that resonated with me as I 
              take inspiration from both, today and the past.

            <h1>Breast Cancer Hawaii (2021)</h1>
            <p>
              In Summer 2021, I volunteered as a design advisor for Breast Cancer Hawaii. Breast Cancer 
              Hawaii’s mission is to improve the quality of life for Hawaii’s breast cancer community by 
              connecting people with relevant resources and meaningful support. During my time with the 
              organization, I designed logos for multiple programs and created design guidelines that 
              visually reflect their mission.
            </p>

            <div class="projectImage">
              <img src="img/work/logo/logo-7.png" onclick="onClick(this)">
              <p class="caption">Logomark for Hearts for Ohana</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              In Hawaii, Ohana means “family” — but it also means “flower” in Japanese. As the founder 
              is Japanese and the language is widely used in Hawaii, I explored how these two concepts 
              could mesh with their brand core values. The Hearts for Ohana logomark is an interpretation 
              of this double entendre that supports the program's purpose and the organization’s visual language.                          
            </p>

            <div class="projectImage">                
              <img src="img/work/logo/logo-8.png" onclick="onClick(this)">
            </div>

            <p>
              I envisioned the logomark to be a symbol that culturally resonates with the local community. 
              It is an expression of Breast Cancer Hawaii's core values, as well as the program's commitment 
              to serve family members.
              <br><br>
              The logomark is a combination of two hearts and a monstera leaf which is widely grown in Hawaii. 
              The abstracted leaf became the center piece that unifies the hearts with it's borders extending 
              outwards to connect the two elements. The color choices reflect the organization's desire to 
              position the topic of cancer as gender-inclusive.

            <h1>Nikkei Garden Farmers Market (2022)</h1>
            <p>
              The inaugural edition of the Nikkei Farmers’ Market “産地直送” is held in the Japanese Garden 
              at the Nikkei National Museum and Cultural Centre in Burnaby, British Columbia. In 2022, the organization 
              held a logo design contest as they kick off the second year of their farmers' market. 
              <br><br>
              My proposal was to develop an identity that visually conveys a sense of Community, Craftsmanship, 
              and Nourishment. These core values are visualized by appearing professional while being inviting.       
            </p>

            <div class="projectImage">
              <img src="img/work/logo/logo-9.gif" onclick="onClick(this)">
              <p class="caption">My proposal for the logo design competition</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              The final design is a personified plant/flower that is protuding out of a seal stamp. It is an 
              articulation of the brand's core values that achieve a balance between professionalism and friendliness.  
              <br><br>
              The open leaves create an inviting gesture as if it is welcoming the audience with open arms. The inkan 
              (印鑑), a seal stamp used in place of a signature on documents in Japan, symbolizes the human touch that 
              shape the foundation of the market. The figure sticking out of the stamp, facing up with a smile reflect 
              the positive energy brought by the vendors. The combination of these visual elements capture Nikkei Garden 
              Farmers' Market's aspiration to be inclusive while empowering the local community with its playful yet 
              polished look.

              The primary symbol is in a vertical layout that includes the “日系” (Nikkei) mark. It is contained inside 
              two layers of rectangles to resemble an emblem, which act as a distinctive badge for the organization. 
              The red and green color variants are offered to represent nourishment and Japanese culture, and alternative 
              layouts of the logo was made to be flexible for different contexts.
