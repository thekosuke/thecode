  						<h3>Scope</h3>
  						<p>To afford to live in their desired place, a common scenario is
                that they must find someone to split the bills with, but also to
                share the same space everyday. Not everyone has the perfect
                roommate lined up before they move, as this in itself is something
                people spend a lot of time to pick carefully.

              <h3>Appeal of Craigslist</h3>
  						<p>
                After looking into different services and how people find
                roommates, I learned that the primary method of finding roommates
                is through Craigslist. Craigslist is powerful because it let’s
                people post whenever, wherever, and browse with ease without
                registering for an account. It allows people to get the job done
                with a small barrier of entry.

              <h3>Scammers</h3>
              <p>
                Despite being the go-to platform for room/roommate finding,
                Craigslist holds numerous problems within its community. Safety has
                always been a concern, especially with posts for roommates, as users
                must be careful with the information they give out online.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div></span></div>

            <div class="copy">
              <p>
                For this reason, anonymity was one of the main concepts behind
                the user experience, yet it also conflicted with the idea of Safety.
                Remaining anonymous is one reason why a service would feel safe
                for users since they aren’t required to reveal any personal
                information, but this small-ask lowers the barrier of entry for
                scammers. The down side to this is that this concept of an open community contain
                inconsistencies in terms of the legitimacy of the posts and responses.

              <h3>Why Do Other Services Fail?</h3>
              <p>
                People continue to use Craigslist because they know other people
                use it as well. More users mean more results. Craigslist also
                contains the most unfiltered results and despite the scammers,
                many posts are in fact relevant. The interface may not be the
                best but it’s simple and easy to use for people to find what they need.

              <p>
                When beginning the room finding process, people either look for
                roommates first and find a place together, or find a new place
                they like and then seek for potential roommates who are interested.
                Although this is a matter of preference, the latter is more popular
                since the person will get more control when making decisions down
                the road, such as interviewing potential roommates, deciding how
                to split the bill, etc.

                When sketching UI concepts, I began thinking about what content
                users would want to see first. At first, I drew out the UI to only
                offer one path, to find roommate(s) first and find a place with
                that roommate, with the assumption that this approach would
                encourage people to get along with their new roommates. But what
                if people don’t want to be friends with their roommates? The UI
                must allow users to choose what to search for based on their needs.

                When designing the interface, I dissected the current experience
                behind finding roommates online. Existing services fail to attract
                users since the features they offer don’t provide enough value for
                the user to continue using it. Instead they add a layer of friction
                to the experience.

                Plus the accuracy of these matches are questionable so people end
                up spending more time than they should be. It’s not worth answering
                surveys or revealing personal information if it isn’t making the

              Although it is almost impossible to pick new roommates for people

                People are dissatisfied with existing services because they are
                expecting the service to find their roommate for them. This experience
                would be more similar to Craigslist, except people would be given
                the help of algorithms that gather different results based on their
                desire and needs. The goal was to help people build a reliable list of
                potential candidates that they could consider to meet and discuss
                in-person. It was about encouraging users meet in-person with more assurance.

            <p>
              After looking into existing UI patterns with the concept of
              search, I realized how the iOS Maps and Google Maps, which contain
              an interactive map with card overlay, are more aimed for a “search
              and find” experience, whereas Airbnb and Kijiji, which contain the
              bottom navigation bar, are both more catered towards a “search and
              browse” experience. Of course this is due to the purpose of
              the product and the UX/UI reflecting the context. I wondered how I
              could apply these concepts in this particular context.

                Because this sector lacks long-term users, I implemented the option
                to toggle between "Active" and "Passive" to communicate who is actively
                or casually looking for roommates. And since asking users to pay for
                the entire service is a high barrier, I chose an experience that provides
                both, free and paid service, similar to other subscription services
                such as Spotify or Headspace.

                The bottom navigation bar allows users to see their options upfront
                while intertwining the content to make different results discoverable.
                Switching the bottom navigation bar when the user opens a post was
                done with the aim to encourage users to continue exploreing through
                different posts. It’s a lot easier to explore content when you don’t
                have to go through different pages, so I thought scrolling and swiping
                was the best interaction to afford such experience.

                My response to the idea of anonymity was to integrate Bitmoji into
                the experience. With this, users don’t have to fully reveal themselves
                but can still give a glimpse of their identity through the digital space.
                This allows users to remain anonymous while presenting themselves in a playful way.

                Bitmoji act as a middle-ground between a selfie and a silhouette,
                or an emoji. It communicates what emojis cannot, which is “identity”.
                An emoji could be anyone in the world, but a Bitmoji becomes a symbolic
                representation of yourself. In this context, Bitmoji is your digital identity.
              </p>
              </br>
              <p>
                Bitmoji also give users an incentive to create an account since only
                account holders would be able to use Bitmoji. Another benefit of creating
                an account would be the ability to bookmark posts.

                Instead, the solution was to simply scroll with given preset headers
