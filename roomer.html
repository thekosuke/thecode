						lot of time to choose carefully.
						<br><br>
						Finding the right place is even more difficult when you’re struggling
						to find the perfect roommate. So I narrowed down the scope by framing
						the problem around improving the experience of finding roommates,
						in order to improve the current experience within room finding.

          <p class="body-copy">
            The primary method of finding roommates is through Craigslist.
						Craigslist is powerful because it let’s people post whenever, wherever,
						and browse with ease without registering for an account. It allows
						people to get the job done with a small barrier of entry.
						<br><br>
						Despite being the go-to platform for room/roommate finding, Craigslist
						holds numerous problems within its community. Safety has always been
						a concern, especially with posts for roommates as users must be
						careful with the information they share online.

          <p class="body-copy">
						For this reason, anonymity became the main concept of the
						user experience yet it also conflicted with the notion of Safety.
						Remaining anonymous gives a sense of safety since they don't need to
						reveal their identity, but it also lowers the barrier of entry for
						scammers. The down side of anonymity is that an open community becomes
						flooded with illegitimate posts and responses.

					<h4 class="project-name">People Use What People Use</h4>
          <p class="body-copy">
						People continue to use Craigslist because they know other people use
						it as well. More users mean more results. Craigslist also contains
						the most unfiltered results and despite the scammers, many posts
						are in fact relevant. The interface may not be the best but it’s
						simple and easy to use for people to find what they need.
						<br><br>
						I also identified three core reasons why room finding services
						struggle to attract users. 1. Cyclical users: people look for a new place or roommate
						a few times a year, and a lot more people search during off-campus
						housing season. 2. Generating growth: Services don’t provide enough
						value for people to pay for their service. And 3. online safety:
						safety has always been a concern with Craigslist—especially with
						posts for roommates—thus users must be careful with the information
						they share online.

					<h4 class="project-name">Current Behavior</h4>
          <p class="body-copy">
						When beginning the room finding process, people either look for
						roommates first and find a place together, or find a new place they
						like and then seek for potential roommates who are interested.
						Although this is a matter of preference, the latter is more popular
						since the person will get more control when making decisions down
						the road, such as interviewing potential roommates, deciding how to
						split the bill, etc.
            <br><br>
						When sketching UI concepts, I began thinking about what content users
						would want to see first. At first, I drew out the UI to only offer
						one path, to find roommate(s) first and find a place with that
						roommate, with the assumption that this approach would encourage
						people to get along with their new roommates. But what if people don’t
						want to be friends with their roommates? The UI must allow users to
						choose what to search for based on their needs.

          <p class="body-copy">
						When designing the interface, I dissected the current experience
						behind finding roommates online. Existing services fail to attract
						users since the features they offer don’t provide enough value for
						the user to continue using it. Instead they add a layer of friction
						to the experience.
						<br><br>
						Plus the accuracy of these matches are questionable so people end up
						spending more time than they should be. It’s not worth answering
						surveys or revealing personal information if it isn’t making the
						process any faster or easier for people.

          <p class="body-copy">
						Although it is almost impossible to pick new roommates for people
						accurately, we could help by improving the experience prior to deciding
						who to meet in-person with. By doing so, the user's expecations when
						using the service is lowered since they are required to find the
						right match on their own.
						<br><br>
						People are dissatisfied with existing services because they are
						expecting the service to find their roommate for them. This experience
						would be more similar to Craigslist, except people would be given
						the help of algorithms that gather different results based on their
						desire and needs. The goal was to help people build a reliable list
						of potential candidates that they could consider to meet and discuss
						in-person. It was about encouraging users meet in-person with more
						assurance.

					<h4 class="project-name">Typology</h4>
          <p class="body-copy">
						After looking into existing UI patterns with the concept of search,
						I realized how the iOS Maps and Google Maps, which contain an
						interactive map with card overlay, are more aimed for a “search and
						find” experience, whereas Airbnb and Kijiji, which contain the bottom
						navigation bar, are both more catered towards a “search and browse”
						experience. Of course this is due to the purpose of the product and
						the UX/UI reflecting the context. I wondered how I could apply these
						concepts in this particular context.

						The screen on the left is the tab specifically for room finding.
						Users are presented with a map and a list of available rooms around
						their current location. Users would be able to adjust their location
						and radius by scaling the map or by adjusting the setting on the top left.
						<br><br>
						Because the sector lacks long-term users, I implemented the option
						to toggle between "Active" and "Passive" to communicate who is actively
						or casually looking for roommates. And since asking users to pay for
						the entire service is a high barrier, I chose an experience that
						provides both, free and paid service, similar to existing subscription
						services such as Spotify or Headspace.
						<br><br>
						The bottom navigation bar allows users to see their options upfront
						while intertwining the content to make different results discoverable.
						Switching the bottom navigation bar when the user opens a post was
						done with the aim to encourage users to continue exploring through
						different posts. It’s a lot easier to explore content when you don’t
						have to go through different pages, so I thought scrolling and swiping
						was the best interaction to afford such experience.

						My response to the idea of anonymity was to integrate Bitmoji into
						the experience. With this, users don’t have to fully reveal themselves
						but can still give a glimpse of their identity through the digital
						space. This allows users to remain anonymous while presenting
						themselves in a playful way.
						<br><br>
						Bitmoji act as a middle-ground between a selfie and a silhouette, or
						an emoji. It communicates what emojis cannot, which is “identity”.
						An emoji could be anyone in the world, but a Bitmoji becomes a symbolic
						representation of yourself. In this context, Bitmoji is your digital
						identity.
						<br><br>
						Bitmoji also give users an incentive to create an account since only
						account holders would be able to use Bitmoji. Another benefit of
						creating an account would be the ability to bookmark posts.
