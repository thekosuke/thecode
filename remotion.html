              <h3>Background</h3>
              <p>
                <a href="https://www.remotion.com/" target="_blank">Remotion</a> is a virtual office that makes room for casual conversations with coworking and shared music. 
                It is a macOS app that lets you pin your teammates to the dock to have background awareness of what 
                people are up to. 
                <br><br>
                I was brought in as a product designer in the Core Experience team to improve the experience around 
                <a href="https://www.remotion.com/blog/product-updates-coworking-rooms" target="_blank">coworking with music</a>. 
                The purpose of coworking with music is to foster a low stress atmosphere in which teams 
                are able to work alongside each other in a common room. A good music experience in coworking 
                rooms should “just work”, though people were confused about some of the UI and its behaviors 
                when they were coworking in a Remotion Room.

              <h3>Music Ducking</h3>
              <p>
                In Remotion, Rooms are where teams come together to regularly work side-by-side with music playing 
                in the background. When someone starts talking in a Room, Remotion automatically lowers the music 
                volume so people can hear each other talk — we referred to this feature as "Ducking". During ducking, 
                volume control was disabled to avoid users from increasing the music volume and create echoes when 
                their mic is on.
              </p>

                <img src="img/work/remotion/remotion-2.png">
                <p class="caption"><i>Past Implementation</i></p>
              </div>                                

              <h1>Problem</h1>
              <p>
                We learned that users were often confused and frustrated when they were unable to adjust 
                the volume while music was being ducked. This was because the disabeld state of the volume control 
                was too subtle and there was no indication of when ducking was happening. They either didn’t 
                know why their music was being lowered or why they couldn't adjust their volume.
                <br><br>
                In order to address these problems, we wanted to clarify how volume control works when music is being 
                lowered, and simplify the volume control so it “just works”.
              </p>

              </div>  

              <h1>How Ducking Works</h1>
              <p>
                Remotion ducks music in two events: when someone in the room is talking, or when your own mic 
                is unmuted. This was done so people can hear each other talk, and so your mic doesn’t pick up 
                music coming from your speakers and create feedback for everyone else in the room.                  
              </p>   
              
              <h1>Scenarios</h1>
              <p>
                The following were common behaviors that users wanted to take when music is being ducked: 
                <br><br>
                1. User’s mic is on so the music is extremely low; the user wants to increase the music volume.<br>
                2. User’s mic is on and the user wants to mute the music volume.<br>
                3. Someone else is talking, music is still too loud or distracting and they want to either mute or lower the music volume.
                <br><br>
                In these scenarios, we wanted to avoid having users turn the music louder unless they muted 
                themselves to prevent echo. We also wanted to let users know when music is ducking so they 
                can take the right action based on their needs.
                <br><br>
                After assessing these common scenarios, we agreed as a team that users should be able to 
                adjust their volume even if the music is ducking since it is a natural reaction for people 
                to want to adjust the volume when their context changes.
              </p>  
              
              <h1>Exploration</h1>
              <p>
                At the top-level, the goal was to find a way to simply communicate the concept of ducking 
                so users can take an informed action — this was the impetus of the design exploration.
              </p>

              <div class="projectImage">
                <img src="img/work/remotion/remotion-4.png">
                <p class="caption"><i>Design Explorations</i></p>
              </div>

              <p>
                An early concept was to include two volume sliders, one for the master volume and another 
                for the ducking strength. Though I decided not to pursue this direction because it created 
                more questions for users who don't fully understand the feature.
                <br><br>
                Another idea was to still automatically lower the volume slider but override the ducked volume 
                when the user chooses to adjust the volume in any direction. The issue here was that we 
                would be dismissing the concept of ducking when the user increases their music volume. We 
                duck music to optimize for a better experience and this iteration defeated this purpose. 
                Later on, this purpose helped me realize that the ducking state shouldn’t appear like an 
                error or warning, thus I deviated from using yellow as an indicator.
                <br><br>
                Lastly, I wanted to introduce two toggles in a single slider — one for the ducked music 
                volume and one for the voice volume. This UI enabled users to have control over both volumes 
                while visually differentiating them. We didn't pursue this design due to the 
                added complexity and it went against the philosophy of music in Remotion. It should “just work” 
                so users don’t have to worry about the underlying complexity.
              </p>    
              
              <h1>Final Design</h1>    
              <p>
                Ultimately, I landed with a UI with an animated display of ducking to better reflect what 
                is happening. Instead of showing a single volume slider moving back and forth, I proposed 
                to visually separate the ducking volume by conveying that it is a portion of the master 
                volume. The animation helped users understand what is happening by showing the progress 
                from not-ducked to fully ducked.
                <br><br>
                The ducked volume is changed to a set percentage of the master volume, so when users adjust 
                the master volume, the ducked volume will always be x% of the master volume. This way users 
                don't have to worry about changing the ducking volume and simply control one volume slider. 
              </p>

              <p>                              
                We initially wanted to guide users to have the best experience by suggesting to turn off 
                their mic if they wish to raise their music volume, but we chose to strip this out for 
                simplicity sake. It required us to increase the size of the popover, which created an 
                undesirable transition when going from not-ducked to fully ducked. Green was used as an 
                indication to reflect the positive spirit of optimizing for a better experience.
