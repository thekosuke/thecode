            <p>
              <a href="https://www.remotion.com/" target="_blank">Remotion</a> is a virtual office that makes 
              room for casual conversations with coworking and shared music. It is a macOS app that lets you 
              pin your teammates to the dock to have background awareness of what people are up to.

              I was brought in as a product designer in the Core Experience team to make focused improvements 
              to the core app. The team consisted of 5 engineers and myself, with the goal to increase retention 
              and word of mouth sharing.

            <p>
              The Core Experience Team's roadmap was driven by the most critical problems that 
              led to user churn. Thus our goal was to hit the "Beta Bar" — a lower quality bar 
              that we’re willing to accept as we’re in a period of rapid iteration. Even in this 
              state, we need to provide an experience that’s good enough where a user likes our 
              product enough to want to share it with others.
              <br><br>
              We focused on solving problems within the core workflows before investing in brand 
              new features that drive new user value (which would be GA).

            <h1>Coworking with Music</h1>
            <p>
              The purpose of Coworking with Music is to foster a low stress atmosphere in which 
              teams are able to work alongside each other in a common room. A good music experience 
              in coworking rooms should “just work”, though people were confused about some of 
              the UI and its behaviors when they were coworking in a Remotion Room.
            <br><br>
              Broadly speaking, the main design objectives were to bring more clarity and consistency 
              in regards to what is happening in the room, educate users how rooms work, and to 
              curate a shared experience for teams to cowork seamlessly. These problems were addressed 
              holistically by identifying opportunities to reach our goals in different surfaces. 
              They were prioritized based on the amount of customer feedback and the severity of the issue.

            <h1>Music Ducking</h1>
            <p>
              In Remotion, Rooms are where teams come together to regularly work side-by-side with music playing 
              in the background. When someone starts talking in a Room, Remotion automatically lowers the music 
              volume so people can hear each other talk — we referred to this feature as "Ducking". During ducking, 
              volume control was disabled to avoid users from increasing the music volume and create echoes when 
              their mic is on.
            </p>    

            <div class="projectImage">
              <img src="img/work/remotion/remotion-7.png" onclick="onClick(this)">
              <p class="caption">Past Implementation</p>
            </div>                                

            <h1>Problem</h1>
            <p>
              We learned that users were often confused and frustrated when they were unable to adjust 
              the volume while music was being ducked. This was because the disabeld state of the volume control 
              was too subtle and there was no indication of when ducking was happening. They either didn’t 
              know why their music was being lowered or why they couldn't adjust their volume.
              <br><br>
              In order to address these problems, we wanted to clarify how volume control works when music is being 
              lowered, and simplify the volume control so it “just works”.
            </p>

            </div>  

            <h1>How Ducking Works</h1>
            <p>
              Remotion ducks music in two events: when someone in the room is talking, or when your own mic 
              is unmuted. This was done so people can hear each other talk, and so your mic doesn’t pick up 
              music coming from your speakers and create feedback for everyone else in the room.                  
            </p>   
            
            <div class="projectImage"></div>     

            <h1>Scenarios</h1>
            <p>
              The following were common behaviors that users wanted to take when music is being ducked: 
              <br><br>
              1. User’s mic is on so the music is extremely low; the user wants to increase the music volume.<br>
              2. User’s mic is on and the user wants to mute the music volume.<br>
              3. Someone else is talking, music is still too loud or distracting and they want to either mute or lower the music volume.
              <br><br>
              In these scenarios, we wanted to avoid having users turn the music louder unless they muted 
              themselves to prevent echo. We also wanted to let users know when music is ducking so they 
              can take the right action based on their needs.
              <br><br>
              After assessing these common scenarios, we agreed as a team that users should be able to 
              adjust their volume even if the music is ducking since it is a natural reaction for people 
              to want to adjust the volume when their context changes.
            </p>  
            
            <div class="projectImage"></div>     

            <h1>Exploration</h1>
            <p>
              At the top-level, the goal was to find a way to simply communicate the concept of ducking 
              so users can take an informed action — this was the impetus of the design exploration.
            </p>

            <div class="projectImage">
              <img src="img/work/remotion/remotion-9.png" onclick="onClick(this)">
              <p class="caption">Design Explorations</p>
            </div>

            <p>
              An early concept was to include two volume sliders, one for the master volume and another 
              for the ducking strength. Though I decided not to pursue this direction because it created 
              more questions for users who don't fully understand the feature.
              <br><br>
              Another idea was to still automatically lower the volume slider but override the ducked volume 
              when the user chooses to adjust the volume in any direction. The issue here was that we 
              would be dismissing the concept of ducking when the user increases their music volume. We 
              duck music to optimize for a better experience and this iteration defeated this purpose. 
              Later on, this purpose helped me realize that the ducking state shouldn’t appear like an 
              error or warning, thus I deviated from using yellow as an indicator.
              <br><br>
              Lastly, I wanted to introduce two toggles in a single slider — one for the ducked music 
              volume and one for the voice volume. This UI enabled users to have control over both volumes 
              while visually differentiating them. We didn't pursue this design due to the 
              added complexity and it went against the philosophy of music in Remotion. It should “just work” 
              so users don’t have to worry about the underlying complexity.
            </p>    

            <div class="projectImage"></div>     
            
            <h1>Final Design</h1>
            <p>
              Ultimately, I landed with a UI with an animated display of ducking to better reflect what 
              is happening. Instead of showing a single volume slider moving back and forth, I proposed 
              to visually separate the ducking volume by conveying that it is a portion of the master 
              volume. The animation helped users understand what is happening by showing the progress 
              from not-ducked to fully ducked.
              <br><br>
              The ducked volume is changed to a set percentage of the master volume, so when users adjust 
              the master volume, the ducked volume will always be x% of the master volume. This way users 
              don't have to worry about changing the ducking volume and simply control one volume slider. 
            </p>

            <p>                              
              We initially wanted to guide users to have the best experience by suggesting to turn off 
              their mic if they wish to raise their music volume, but we chose to strip this out for 
              simplicity sake. It required us to increase the size of the popover, which created an 
              undesirable transition when going from not-ducked to fully ducked. Green was used as an 
              indication to reflect the positive spirit of optimizing for a better experience.

            <h1>Single Music Platform</h1>
            <p>
              Remotion Rooms are integrated with YouTube and Spotify to offer shared music in the background 
              to cover the awkward silence when teams cowork online. YouTube plays by default when the first 
              person joins the room, and can switch to Spotify if they have the Spotify Desktop App downloaded. 
              Even though members can share their Spotify, others in the room can choose not to listen to the 
              shared music and listen to YouTube instead.
              <br><br>
              Although this was the most popular feature amongst our customers, we learned that team members 
              were still siloed and not sure what others in the room were experiencing. We realized that 
              allowing members to listen to YouTube and Spotify simultaneously misaligned with the purpose 
              behind Rooms — to encourage shared experiences for remote teams. 
            </p>   

            <div class="projectImage">

            </div>                                

            <h1>Goal</h1>
            <p>
              With the problems that surfaced from allowing teams to listen to both music platforms at the 
              same time, we saw the benefit of only allowing one music platform at a time to declutter the 
              UI, remove the complexity that comes with enabling both platforms, and encourage teams to 
              have a shared experience in Rooms.
              <br><br>
              To achieve these goals I aimed to make Spotify easy to discover, provide better context of 
              the shared stream, and show who is listening to the shared Spotify stream.
            </p>

            <h1>Iteration</h1>
            <p>
              In one of the iterations, I focused on implicitly communicating the dynamic between 
              the person sharing their music (DJ), and the people listening to the shared music (Listeners). 
              I executed this by having the DJ accept a request when someone else wants to share Spotify 
              or switch platforms. I believed this could be a way to establish roles within the room 
              while giving each other a heads up when switching music streams.
              <br><br>
              Though I later realized that this was adding extra friction and complicated the experience. 
              Plus, there wouldn’t be a DJ when YouTube is playing since it’s not a shared music stream. Thus 
              I decided to keep the experience simple and lean in on the users to communicate with each 
              other when switching streams.
            </p>

            <h1>Final Design</h1>
            <p>
              To align with Remotion’s plan to publicly launch the Spotify feature, we aimed to make Spotify 
              easy to discover since YouTube is the default music player in Rooms. We wanted to guide the first 
              person in the room to start sharing Spotify, and because we’ve shifted to only allow one music 
              platform at a time, we wanted to encourage others to join in on the shared Spotify so they aren’t 
              sitting in silence.
              <br><br>
              This was achieved by showing a popover when someone joins a Room for the first time as part of 
              their onboarding experience. If a user doesn’t have the Spotify Desktop App or permissions enabled, 
              they won’t be able to listen in. To support this case, we explained what is happening and made 
              the popover actionable to resolve the issue.
            </p>

            <p>
              When music is playing, I clarified who has control over the music depending on the context through 
              copy refinement. I also replaced the “Change Song” button with the song thumbnail with the belief 
              that people want to see song details. This UI update adds to the feeling of a shared experience 
              and was complemented by exposing the listeners.
            </p>

            </div>  

            <p>
              Lastly I had to find a way to notify people when the room is switching music platforms. Whenever 
              the switch happens, members are notified with a popover that is actionable to opt-in or out right away.
