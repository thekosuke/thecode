              <h2>Background</h2>
              <p>
                In Summer 2021, I volunteered as a design advisor for <a href="https://www.breastcancerhawaii.org/" target="_blank">Breast Cancer Hawaii</a>. 
                Breast Cancer Hawaii’s mission is to improve the quality of life for 
                Hawaii’s breast cancer community by connecting people with relevant 
                resources and meaningful support. During my time with the organization, I designed 
                logos for multiple programs and created design guidelines that visually 
                reflect their mission. 
                <br><br>
                This is a documentation of the logo design work I did for one of their
                programs—Hearts for Ohana.

              <h2>Brand Core</h2>
              <p>
                Breast Cancer Hawaii’s brand core values are the essence of what makes 
                their organization unique, valuable and successful. 
                <br><br>
                To begin the brand enhancement, I discussed with the founder to synthesize 
                the value and experience the organization aims to deliver to their participants.
                Through our conversations, the founder expressed that the visual language 
                should encompass all people who are navigating their own breast cancer 
                diagnosis, along with uplifting those who might be overwhelmed. 
                <br><br>
                It was important to emphasize that breast cancer, as a topic, is relevant to all genders and 
                all family members. Hearts for Ohana in particular seeks to support the whole family, 
                particularly the children, as Hawaii currently faces a gap in direct services 
                and resources for children whose parent(s) is/are facing a cancer diagnosis.

              <h2>Exploration</h2>
              <p>              
                My goal was to visually articulate the core values through different design 
                elements that make up the logo. While doing so, I pushed for a modern 
                look and feel that convey a sense of profession and trustworthiness while 
                preserving the playfulness.
              </p>

              <h2>Logomark</h2>
              <p>              
                In Hawaii, Ohana means “family”—but it also means “flower” in Japanese. 
                As the founder is Japanese and the language is widely used in Hawaii, 
                I explored how these two concepts could mesh with their brand core values.
                The Hearts for Ohana logomark is an interpretation of this double entendre that 
                supports the program's purpose and the organization’s visual language.            
              </p>                       
              <div class="project-image">
                <img src="img/work/bch/bch-6.png"><br><br>
                <img src="img/work/bch/bch-7.png"><br><br><br><br>
              </div> 
              <p>                            
                I envisioned the logomark to be a symbol that culturally resonates with 
                the local community. It is an expression of Breast Cancer Hawaii's core values, 
                as well as the program's commitment to serve family members.
                <br><br>
                The logomark is a combination of two hearts and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstera_deliciosa" target="_blank">monstera leaf</a> 
                which is widely grown in Hawaii. The abstracted leaf became the center piece 
                that unifies the hearts with it's borders extending outwards to connect 
                the two elements. The color choices reflect the organization's desire to position 
                the topic of cancer as gender-inclusive.
  
              </p>  
              <br>  
              <div class="project-image">            
                <img src="img/work/bch/bch-8.png"><br><br><br><br>
              </div> 
              <p>              
                One of the constraints for the brand guidelines was for the fonts to be 
                accessible to anyone who is expected to apply the brand to their materials. 
                With this, I chose <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand" target="_blank">Quicksand</a> 
                as the primary typeface due to its quirky yet legible form that introduced a friendly 
                tone to the brand. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_(typeface)" target="_blank">Georgia</a>, 
                a serif typeface, was used as a complimentary element to appear elegant while 
                contrasting with the playful visual language.
