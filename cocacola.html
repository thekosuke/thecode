              During my time at R/GA Tokyo, I was given the opportunity to apply
              my learnings through a self-directed pitch for Coca-Cola Japan. The
              pitch involves addressing the company's contribution to plastic pollution
              and cultural frictions in Japan through the lens of experience design.

              Coca-Cola alone is responsible for a sixth of all plastic
              bottles sold around the world, as they revealed it used three million
              tonnes of plastic packaging in 2017.
              <br><br>
              In response to the backlash the company received from their use of
              plastic, Coca-Cola shared their vision to use 100% recyclable material
              for their bottles and achieve a 90% Bottle-to-Bottle production
              ratio by the year 2030.

            <p class="body-copy">
              There are over 5.5 million vending machines in Japan—one
              for every 23 people, the highest ratio in the world—but companies
              struggle to attract younger people to vending machines since these
              generation of people grew up during the rise of convenience stores.
              Japan now has a convenience store in every other block, and people
              actually prefer buying at convenience stores because it's cheaper, closer,
              and has a variety of products.
              <br><br>
              Despite this growth in convenience stores, vending machines are still an
              ubiquitous cultural artifact that are commonly used by the Japanese population.
              Coca-Cola leads the market by owning 27% of vending machines in Japan, and is
              now increasing the number of “smartphone vending machines” to attract the
              younger demographic. Coca-Cola Japan introduced a royalty program that
              affords in-app payment through their mobile app Coke-On.
              <br><br>
              Other brands like
              <a href="https://www.kirin.co.jp/company/about/kirinbeverage/expansion/jihanki/tappiness/" target="_blank">Kirin</a>
              and <a href="https://www.acurepass.co.jp/en/index.html" target="_blank">acure</a>
              are rethinking their vending machines
              by integrating new payment methods or creating digital experiences that
              offer new value. Historically Coca-Cola has been known to carry a
              progressive attitude and this sheds light to the opportunity of innovation in
              the vending machine experience. How could Coca-Cola Japan disrupt
              the market by reimagining the vending machine experience?

            <p class="body-copy">
              Japan remains a leading plastic consumer, with the second-largest
              per-capita consumption of single-use plastic products, trailing only the United States.
              However, Japan also leads the world in recycling rate, which was
              fostered by daily reinforcements from the education system and a
              sense of responsibility to meet community expectations.
              <br><br>
              Japanese people became environmentally conscious after
              the great earthquake that occurred in 2011. Though years after the
              disaster, people have lost interest and the younger generation lack
              the awareness of their actions as it became a habitual act that is
              done as a social manner.
              <br><br>
              Despite the high recycling rate, Japanese adults’—particularly
              young adults—interest in the environment is declining since the
              big earthquake in 2011. 55 percent of age 20-30 women and 44 percent
              of age 20-30 men stated that they don’t know what they should do to
              improve the environment.
              <br><br>
              Many people have shared that they want to know how their daily
              contribution is actually affecting the environment. So how could
              Coca-Cola Japan make both, recycling and vending machines attractive
              to the younger demographic to facilitate shared value creation?

              What if Coca-Cola could reimagine the vending machine experience
              in order to disrupt the fragmented market while bringing back a
              sense of purpose to Japan's recycling culture?
              <br><br>
              The proposed solution is to install reverse vending machines that
              are streamlined with the existing Coke ON app to incentivize effective
              recycling while attracting the younger demographic to use vending machines.
              With Coca-Cola's ubiquitous vending machines, their existing digital
              offering, and their precedents of Reverse Vending Machines,
              there's a viable solution for the brand to address their business problem
              while aligning with their 2030 vision.
              <br><br>
              The experience must be transparent in order to communicate the individual
              impact, it must deliver branded interactions that engage the younger
              demographic, and it must foster a sense of community that empower
              people to participate in the shared value creation as Coca-Cola's partner.
