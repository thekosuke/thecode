            In 2018, I was one of twelve senior students selected to participate
            in italiaDesign, an 8-month undergraduate field school program directed
            by <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/siat/people/teaching-faculty/russell-taylor.html" target="_blank">Russell Taylor</a>.
            The team interviewed and filmed emerging and established designers in
            Italy to learn how design is understood in a foreign context. We then
            capsuled these films in a web experience to contribute to the legacy of
            italiaDesign field school.

          <p class="body-copy">
            We challenged ourselves to develop a brand identity that is unique
            to our experience in Italy. We wanted to translate this identity onto
            a web experience that creatively captured our learnings from field school
            in order to communicate the purpose of our study.

            Past field school sites each carried their own unique identity, though
            the annual launch of these sites have created a template-like pattern
            that lost a sense of purpose behind the organization of the content.
            We challenged ourselves to go beyond the template by rethinking our process.

            The initial process was to establish our visual identity before
            considering the user experience, though this lead to a linear process
            that overlooked the actual content.
            <br><br>
            We decided to follow a parallel process in which we begin considering
            the organization of content along with the user experience to enhance our brand.
            This was done by simultaneously designing and building to actually see
            how our strategy is being reflected in the experience.

            We established design principles to guide our decision making: Embrace
            Ambiguity, Respect the Copy, and Highlight the Designers. We wanted
            the experience to reflect these values to communicate where we were
            coming from.
            <br><br>
            Ambiguity was an excerpt from <a href="https://rationale-design.com/resources/vignelli-canon/" target="_blank">The Vignelli Canon</a>,
            in which spoke about how making contradictions in your design can
            enhance the quality of work. We wondererd how this philosophy could
            be applied to a web experience.

            While iterating on the landing page, I had aimed to contain all the
            information in one view to allow immediate access to all the content.
            Though I realized this was simply a false constraint that limited our
            opportunity to challenge people’s expectations.
            <br><br>
            It’s important to reduce frictions to achieve an intuitive user experience,
            but I also value the emotional impact that can be evoked through interactions.
            We wanted to challenge expectations with interactions that helped tell the
            greater narrative that we strategically constructed.

            We created a landing page that encourage people to scroll and engage

            By packaging the films into three distinct volumes, we implied a linear narrative and
            gave meaning to the organization of content. With the hover interaction,

            the film title and volume description.

            Because our films focused on the designers' unique practice rather
            than their work, we saw value in including the work along with bite-size
            quotes as extended content for people to actually see how these designers
            apply their design philosophy onto their work.
            <br><br>
            With the slideshow format, we were able to imply a linear narrative through
            the work while presenting relevant content piece-by-piece.

              “The reason for design is actually 'why design' Well there's lots
              of reasons why... how it can help and make things better, but I
              think the most core reason of why design is 'because'. Because I
              want it to be. So just kind of that point of conviction is where
              good things happen.”
