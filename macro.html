            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
              In April 2020, I joined <a href="https://usemacro.com" target="_blank">Macro</a> 
              as their first employee. As the founding designer at a B2B SaaS startup, I generate 
              design solutions that are practical, scalable and intentional.
              <br><br>
              In short, Macro is a tool for people to design and deploy custom 
              operational processes without writing code. We believe employees should now be 
              able to create custom software to solve their problems.
              <br><br>
              In early 2010s, tooling for designers were underrepresented. We didn't have a 
              Figma or Sketch to visualize our ideas. In early 2020s, this is the case for 
              Operations teams. Ops teams need a way to build and run their operational 
              processes but there currently isn't a single tool that enable 
              teams to do so in a simple, personal, and comprehensive way.
              <br><br>
              Macro reimagines checklists as the means to create, assign, track, and automate processes 
              involving people and software. We want to deliver a tool that teams love using.

            <h3>Logo and Brand</h3>
            <p>
              Designing the Macro logo was something I was super excited about. I went 
              through a number of iterations to explore different concepts while synthesizing 
              the co-founder's vision. I consider logos to be something deeply personal to founders, 
              so I started my process by learning what Macro meant to them. Their story and 
              the thought they had put into the company was referred througout my process. 
              Each column below reflects an idea and each iteration informed the next design. 
            </p>
            <div class="project-image">
              <img src="img/work/macro/macro-2.png">
            </div>   
            <p>
              <br>
              As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rand" target="_blank">Paul Rand</a> once said, 
              “The principal role of a logo is to identify, and simplicity is its means… Its effectiveness 
              depends on distinctiveness, visibility, adaptability, memorability, universality, and 
              timelessness.” This belief was stored in the back of my mind to assess whether the design 
              has reached a certain threshold of quality.              
            </p>
            <div class="project-image">
              <img src="img/work/macro/macro-3.png">
            </div>  
            <p>
              <br>
              The logo stands for what Macro—the company, product and team—aspires to 
              become, not what it is today. The aspiration is to become an <b>accessible pro tool</b> 
              that offers a more humane way for people to work with technology. <b>In essence, we want 
              people to focus on work that requires empathy.</b>
              <br><br>
              With respect to this ideology, I believed the logo should look and feel <b>modern, 
              robust, and familiar</b>. I believed these were qualities that 
              reflected what an "accessible pro tool" would have. At last Avante Garde was used for 
              the logotype, which is also used for the corporate logo of Adidas and is one of the main typefaces 
              in Sony’s corporate marketing programs. The modernist typeface that is already used in 
              various places helped convey a sense of boldness, progression, and profession.
            </p>
            <div class="project-image">

            <p>
              <br>
              The term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)" target="_blank">macro</a> 
              is a programming concept that is like an algorithm or a set of actions that 
              people can use or run multiple times. A macro helps automate repeating tasks by recording or 
              storing input sequences like mouse strokes or keyboard presses. Once this input is stored, 
              it makes up a macro which is open to any possible changes.
              <br><br>
              I intended the 'O' to reflect this concept while making it the visual element of recognition 
              that gives the logotype a unique characteristic. The 'O' is also a parenthesis.
