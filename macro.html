                is a process management tool for teams to design and deploy custom operational processes 
                without writing code. In April 2020, I joined Macro as employee #1. Our goal was to 
                build the MVP to release to the public and collect user feedback in order 
                to find product-market fit. As the first designer at a B2B SaaS startup, I generated 
                design solutions that are practical, scalable, and intentional.                
                <br><br>
                I worked directly with the co-founders to develop the product from zero to one. Throughout 
                my time, I conducted user interviews, identified problems, explored countless iterations of 
                Macro, and collaborated with engineers to turn my designs into a usable app.

              <h3>Problem</h3>
              <p>
                There are tools out there that help you automate workflows (e.g. Zapier), but not all work 
                can be fully automated. Most work still requires human involvement, yet companies today 
                don’t have a solution for human-in-the-loop processes. Many teams used static 
                documents that lived on tools like Google Docs or Notion that didn’t give them 
                the ability to document, assign, track, and automate common actions in a single context. 
                <br><br>
                With Macro, Operations teams can create, run and track custom workflows in a single context. 
                Workflows are visualized in a dynamic two-pane checklist UI that provides a simple view of 
                their work while enabling them to complete tasks that involve people and a suite of third-party apps. 
              </p>

            <section id="section3">
              <h3>Visualizing Workflows</h3>
              <p>                                
                The left pane allowed teams to build their workflows in a checklist like they would in the 
                documentation tools they’re familiar with. These tasks consist of a variety of task types 
                (e.g. completing forms, uploading files, sending a templated email) that users configure on 
                the right pane to combine commonly used apps and human tasks into a single place.         
                <br><br>
                The main challenge that I continued to face was keeping the checklist clean and simple while 
                adding features that enabled collaboration and customizations. We didn’t want the UI 
                to be overwhelming and feel heavy for teams to get started.
              </p>  

              <div class="projectImage">
                <img src="img/work/macro/macro-3.png">
                <p class="caption"><i>Checklist Editor - Where Teams Build Their Workflows</i></p>
              </div> 

              <p>                      
                In response, I established a rule to keep checklist-level information on the left pane and 
                task-level information on the right pane. The tabs on the right pane gave people space for 
                further configurations, but I didn’t want to hide automations under a tab since they were 
                an integral part of Macro. This led me to surface automation below each task to indicate 
                what happens after completing a particular task, while showcasing the power of Macro.        
                <br><br>
                At the task-level, regular tasks had to be visually and functionally distinguished from 
                third-party integrations. This was for usability reasons but also considering the 
                scalability of the UI. Macro integrated with a suite of third-party apps to support 
                various use cases, so it was important for the UI to be flexible.                                
              </p>

              <h3>Tracking Processes</h3>
              <p>
                With Macro being a process management tool, it was obvious that teams needed a way to 
                keep track of their processes. The challenge here was deciding where this view belongs 
                and the best way to help teams track progress at a glance.
                <br><br>
                I explored a version where people can track all of their checklists in a single view, 
                but this quickly became overloaded since teams would have numerous runs (a deployed 
                checklist) for the same checklist. I ultimately chose to make the view accessible from 
                the Checklist Preview so teams can track all the runs by checklist, which was separated 
                by tabs in order of relevancy. Another iteration took shape in a collapsible accordion 
                instead of tabs but this hid the other categories beneath the scroll which made it 
                difficult to access the information when needed.
              </p>   

              <div class="projectImage">
                <img src="img/work/macro/macro-5.png">
                <p class="caption"><i>Track Processes</i></p>
              </div> 

              <p>                                                
                Within each run, there were a set of tasks that needed to be tracked. After talking 
                to our users, I learned that knowing which specific task a team member is on isn’t 
                as important as the actual progress and the directly responsible individual. Thus I 
                included a progress bar for each run, along with the most helpful information in each 
                column for teams to manage their work.
              </p>

            <section id="section5">
              <h3>Assigning Work</h3>
              <p>
                The Inbox was one of the biggest design challenges for Macro. Macro supported two types 
                of task assignments: a single task and a checklist run. The underlying tension was 
                the difference in user experience for a manager vs. a member. A member could be assigned 
                a set of tasks inside a checklist, but a manager or a team lead might be responsible 
                for completing the entire checklist.
                <br><br>
                With these factors, it was important to clearly distinguish a checklist from a task 
                while allowing users to easily view the work they're responsible for. 
                The Inbox is a place where members come to see what they need to worry about, so 
                it had to be designed in a way that required minimum thinking for members to make 
                sense of their work.                                
              </p>   

              <div class="projectImage">

                <p class="caption"><i>All Your Tasks in a Single View</i></p>
              </div> 

              <p>
                The solution here was ultimately to bundle all the tasks inside its respected checklist 
                run and only show members the tasks they are responsible for. If they wish to get a holistic 
                view of the checklist run, they can always click into the checklist. We created a section at 
                the top of the Inbox to show ad-hoc tasks that are not part of a checklist. For these 
                independent tasks, users can view and complete them without having to leave their Inbox.

              <h3>Design System</h3>
              <p>
                As product concepts began to take shape, it was vital for Macro to implement a 
                <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/YEgsLAVvz4FRzqJDLrTnxi/Design-System-2.1.0?node-id=1100%3A0" target="_blank">design system</a> 
                that helped the team design and build features quickly. This was for my own process as 
                the sole designer, but also to help engineers ship features efficiently while 
                refining the product over time.
                <br><br>
                I was committed to designing the product in a scalable and flexible way. This meant creating 
                reusable components to reduce engineering cost when building new screens. As the one 
                designing this system, I considered these two points while foreseeing how the product 
                will evolve over time.
