                    <p>
                      The art direction was inspired by the pop culture aesthetic
                      from the 80’s and 90’s, in which vibrant colors and modern
                      typography were often applied to a wide range of designs
                      such as casette packaging. The choice of modern typography
                      align with the brand’s objective to express the hope that
                      technology brings through the use of vibrant colors.

              <h3>Typeface</h3>
              <p>
                When designing the logotype, I began the process by selecting a
                typeface that best represents KYBRD as a brand, while reflecting
                the energy of the young readers. With a playful, yet precise form,
                GT Walsheim contains unique characteristics that distinguish it
                from conventional sans serifs. With eight different weights and
                a condensed version, the typeface offers flexibility to explore
                various ways to achieve hierarchy.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div></span></div>

          <div class="image-space grid-5">
            <div></span></div>
            <div>
              <div class="project-image">
                <img src="img/kybrd-assets/typography.png" alt="Brand">
              </div>

            <div></span></div>
            <div class="copy">
              <p>
              The use of uppercase for the logotype was an aestheic decision
              since despite the legibility, the lowercase ‘k’, ‘b’ and ‘d’
              created undesirable spaces within the overall form, whereas the
              uppercase letters become a geometrical block that act as a clean
              visual element within the magazine cover.
              </p>

            <div></span></div>

            <div class="copy">
              <p>
                The unique characteritic of the letter ‘Y’ was the driving factor
                when selecting the typeface as the angled ‘Y’ became an element
                of recognition with the aspiration to deliver a memorable logo.
                The negative spaces created between ‘K’ and ‘B’ introduced an
                interesting relationship among the letters. The space between the
                last three letters were tightened to achieve an asymmetrical
                balance, as a symmetrical form can be too settling for the eye.
                The intent was to bring attention to the first two letters with
                the use of negative space.

              <p>
                The four colors were added to bring a playful tone to the bold
                typeface, which was complimented by the addition of four stripes
                that gave a distinguishable characteristic to the overall form.
                The combination of warm and cool colors were chosen due to the
                contrast it created with each other, as well as the monochromatic
                color scheme. This was initially inspired by Paul Rand’s IBM logo,
                in which the 13 stripes became an iconic representation of technology
                that IBM stood for.

              <h3>Cover Design</h3>
              <p>
                The cover was designed to capture the essence of youth to grab
                the target demographic’s attention with the use of playful
                illustrations, vibrant colors, and bold typography. This was
                executed by using illustrated emojis that can also be found in
                the feature article, as it helps establish a consistent theme
                across the issue. I chose to exclude other cover lines and hero
                the feature story in order to reflect the bold and playful brand identity.

                The monochrome logotype was used since the color version was
                fighting with the colorful illustration for attention. The
                logotype will be alternated with the color version depending on
                that issue’s cover design since the use of illustration is
                specific to this feature story. The idea was to have a logotype
                that could adapt to all types of graphics in order to portray a
                playful brand consistently through each issue.

              <p>
                To align with the topic of the story, the editorial layout design
                mimics the Facebook brand with their brand color and illustrations
                that is reminiscent of the one’s used on their platform. With an
                target audience of age 13 to 19, a graphic-heavy layout with a larger
                body copy was necessary to keep readers engaged. The tone of the
                color remained consistent with the cover design while portraying
                the Facebook brand with the extended use of blue.

              <p>
                The second spread delivers an unconventional way of reading as it visually
                represents a timeline with a path that guide readers through the
                content. Using bold numbers while breaking the grid with a curved
                path allowed for a dynamic layout that align with the brand concept.

                The Table of Contents was designed first with the readers in mind.
                The intention was to create a layout with a clear hierarchy that
                communicated the content within the entire magazine.

              <p>
                The campaign was created with the intent to increase yearly
                subscribers by emphasizing the price of the special offer. With
                more subscribers for the print edition, the magazine will be able
                to increase revenue in advertisements. This was done by applying
                color and bolding the price of the offer to grab the readers’
                attention. With the call to action being the largest text, the
                perks of subscribing was placed underneath to allow readers to
                understand the value in a quick glance.
