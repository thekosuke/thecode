                italiaDesign is an 8-month field school program offered by Simon 
                Fraser University, where students research and experience Italy’s 
                rich design culture. italiaDesign field school is ran 
                bi-annually with a team of ~12 students directed by 
                <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/siat/people/teaching-faculty/russell-taylor.html" target="_blank">Russell Taylor</a>. 
                <br><br>
                I was fortunate to be part of the 2018 cohort to go through this experience.

            <h4>Travel and Interviews</h4>
            <p>
                Within our 8-month study, we spent 2-months in Italy immersing 
                ourselves in the country’s history and culture. We traveled between 
                Rome, Milan, Florence, Bologna, Liguria, and a day trip to Switzerland 
                after visiting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessi_(Italian_company)" target="_blank">Alessi factory</a>. During our time in Milan, we got to 
                interview emerging and established Italian designers - ranging from 
                graphic design, type design, industrial design, and digital design. 
                Getting exposure to different disciplines have broadened my point of view 
                on design and deepened my interest in the practice.

            <h4>italiaDesign Website</h4>
            <p>
                After our trip to Italy, we produced a series of short films and 
                made a website to present them. The ultimate intention behind the 
                website was to create a documentation of our experience in this 
                field school program, and share our learnings with the community. 
                I designed the website with <a href="https://annettecheung.com/" target="_blank">Annette</a> 
                and <a href="https://www.vvichael.com/" target="_blank">Michael</a> 
                while spearheading the development side of things. 
                <br><br>
                With an open brief, I proposed a framework and design direction 
                with consideration to the team's strengths and the content we captured. 
                I lead the entire process—from conception to delivery—while contributing 
                to storytelling, user experience, visual design, and web development.
                <br><br>
                The concept of the website was to package the content into themes to 
                guide the audience to the topic they are interested in. As a team, we 
                chose to stay in the background since this website wasn't about us. We 
                focused on the designers that showed their generosity by sharing their 
                wisdom with us.

            <h4>Hindsight</h4>
            <p>
                We were able to share our interviews and a fraction of our experience 
                through the website, but the entire 8-month program in itself was a 
                very personal experience for each of us. 
                <br><br>
                I enjoyed the weekly presentations and discussions we had in the 
                first four months. We showed up every Friday to share our research and 
                learnings on Italian art and design history. We delve into their food culture 
                and other nuances that we wouldn't have learned on our own. We also took an 
                Italian course as a team to learn the basics—learning a new language is 
                very hard, much respect to those who have.
                <br><br>
                The feeling to be in Italy after studying it in-depth on our laptops
                was unparalleled. Because we had done the research, we were able to appreciate 
                the history and respect the culture throughout our trip. Though it's not just 
                the in-field study—living and working with my peers for two months 
                was a valuable experience that inspired self-reflection.
                <br><br>
                In hindsight, I sort of see this as my graduate project. We spent four months 
                researching a subject and immersed ourselves in a foreign environment with that 
                knowledge. We got to interact with local people and learn how design fits inside 
                a particular culture. The website was our opportunity to share what we learned 
                from the past six months and have it documented like a time capsule. 
                <br><br>
                All that to say, I learned a lot.
