            In 2018, I was one of twelve senior students selected to participate
            in italiaDesign, an 8-month undergraduate field school program directed
            by <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/siat/people/teaching-faculty/russell-taylor.html" target="_blank">Russell Taylor</a>.
            The team interviewed emerging and established designers in Italy to
						learn how the discipline of design is practiced in a foreign context.
						We encapsulated these interviews in a web experience to contribute
						to the legacy of italiaDesign field school.

						Field school websites are launched annually with each team expressing
						their voice through the brand. Each team possess its own unique quality, 
                        though with that being said, the most recent
						team has a responsibility to respond to the previous years by
						introducing a new idea to the catalogue of field school websites.
						I believe this is one way to show our appreciation for being part
						of something greater than ourselves—to contribute to the legacy by
						sharing our learnings and applying it on this website.
						<br><br>
						With respect to the legacy, we aimed to deliver our own interpretation
						of the field school site by developing an identity that is unique to
						our experience in Italy. We challenged ourselves to introduce a new
						idea without breaking the existing architecture of the site.

            Past field school sites each carried their own unique identity, though
            the annual launch of these sites have created a template-like pattern
            that lost a sense of purpose behind certain aspects of the site.
            We established a strategy with consideration to the cards we were
						dealt with in order to approach the project from a different angle.

            The initial process was to establish a visual identity that would then
						be applied to the user experience. Though we recognized that this linear
						process overlooks the strategy behind the content organization, as
						each year contain different types of film content.
            <br><br>
            Instead, we followed a parallel process in which we strategically package
						the content to give substance to the user experience. We envisioned our
						content strategy to be the vehicle that enhance the brand. We were also
						able to design and build simultaneously, which allowed us to conduct
						user testing and validate our assumptions throughout the process.

            We established design principles that would guide the process by

            Ambiguity was an excerpt from <a href="https://rationale-design.com/resources/vignelli-canon/" target="_blank">The Vignelli Canon</a>,
            in which spoke about how making contradictions in your design can
            enhance the quality of the work. We wondererd how this philosophy could
            be applied to a web experience.

            While iterating on the landing page, we were unconsciously constraining
						ourselves to follow good UX practices, which could be a bad habit for
						UX designers. Not every experience has to be frictionless if we could
						sacrifice usability to increase impact. We recognized that this false
						constraint limited our opportunity to challenge people’s expectations.
            <br><br>
            It’s important to reduce frictions to achieve an intuitive user experience,
            but we also valued the emotional impact that could be evoked through
						memorable interactions. It was that 'Wow' moment we repeatedly encountered
						during user testing that made us wonder how we could push the boundaries
						even further. We wanted to bring excitement with purposeful interactions
						that enhance the greater narrative.

            By packaging the films into three distinct volumes, we implied a linear

            <br><br>
            We deviated from the conventional play button by utilizing the slitted

            At the end of each designer's story, we included a ‘Volume Preview’

            while connecting the concept of the greater narrative.

              “The reason for design is actually 'why design' Well there's lots
              of reasons why... how it can help and make things better, but I
              think the most core reason of why design is 'because'. Because I
              want it to be. So just kind of that point of conviction is where
              good things happen.”
