                italiaDesign is an 8-month field school program offered by Simon 
                Fraser University, where students research and experience Italy’s 
                rich design culture. italiaDesign field school is ran 
                bi-annually with a team of ~12 students directed by 
                <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/siat/people/teaching-faculty/russell-taylor.html" target="_blank">Russell Taylor</a>.

            <h3>Travel and Interviews</h3>
            <p>
                Within our 8-month study, we spent 2-months in Italy immersing 
                ourselves in the country’s history and culture. We traveled between 
                Rome, Milan, Florence, Bologna, Liguria, and a day trip to Switzerland 
                after visiting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessi_(Italian_company)" target="_blank">Alessi factory</a>. During our time in Milan, we got to 
                interview emerging and established Italian designers - ranging from 
                graphic design, type design, industrial design, and digital design. 
                Getting exposure to different disciplines have broadened my point of view 
                on design and deepened my interest in the practice.

            <h3>italiaDesign—11th Edition</h3>
            <p>
                After our trip to Italy, we produced a series of short films and 
                made a website to present them. I designed the website with <a href="https://annettecheung.com/" target="_blank">Annette Cheung</a> 
                and <a href="https://www.vvichael.com/" target="_blank">Michael Lo</a> while taking the lead to build the site. I 
                played an essential role in the entire development of the website 
                - from brand direction, storytelling, user experience, visual 
                design, and web development.

            <h3>Hindsight</h3>
            <p>
                We were able to share our interviews and a fraction of our experience 
                through the website, but the entire 8-month program in itself was a 
                very personal experience for each of us. 
                <br><br>
                I enjoyed the weekly presentations and discussions we had in the 
                first four months. We showed up every Friday to share research on Italian 
                art and design history. We learned their food culture and other nuances 
                that we wouldn't have learned on our own. We also took an Italian course 
                as a team to learn the basics. Learning a new language is very hard, much 
                respect to those who have.
                <br><br>
                The feeling to be in Italy after studying it in-depth on our laptops
                was unparalleled. Because we had done the research, we were able to appreciate 
                the history and respect the culture throughout our trip. Though it's not just 
                the in-field study - living and working with my peers for two months 
                was an experience that inspired self-reflection. 
                <br><br>
                In hindsight, I sort of see this as my graduate project. We were able to 
                spend four months researching a culture and immerse ourselves in a foreign 
                environment with that knowledge. We got to interact with local people and 
                learn how design fits inside a particular context. The website was our opportunity 
                to share what we learned from the past six months and have it 
                documented like a time capsule.
