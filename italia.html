                italiaDesign is an 8-month undergraduate field school offered by
                the School of Interactive Arts & Technology at Simon Fraser University.
                The purpose of field school is to expose students to an authentic
                design culture and teach the discipline of design in a different
                context. I was one of twelve senior design students selected to
                participate in this legacy project, as our team conducted in-field
                research and interviews which were produced into a series of films.
                These films are encapsulated in a website that we created after
                our experience in Italy.
              </br></br>
                This is a documentation of the key decisions made throughout the
                creation of the site in addition to my contribution to the project.

                The past sites were executed very well, so we didn’t want to break
                the existing information architecture. Our challenge was to
                establish our own identity while crafting an engaging user
                experience that aligned with our specific film content, as our
                films were more focused on personal design philosophies instead
                of the designers' work like past field school films had done.

                from <i>The Vignelli Canon</i>. Massimo Vignelli was a designer who was
                respected by the team, as well as some of the designers we interviewed,
                so we wanted our site to pay homage to his legacy.

                iterating through the visual identity. An example of this was
                the decision to refer to ourselves as '11th Edition', rather than
                '2018' or 'Gruppo 11', or calling the team page 'Credits', instead

              <h3>Ambiguity, from <i>The Vignelli Canon</i></h3>
              <p>
                The concept of Ambiguity, reinforced by the use of contradictions,
                lead me to ponder about the current climate within the discipline
                of design. Here's my interpretation of Ambiguity:
              </p>
              </br>
              <p>All these "UX Trend" articles, create a perception that
                designers must follow a pattern and work a certain way,
                as if there's a template to become a good designer. Though there's no
                such thing as a single design practice that all designers should
                follow in order to achieve quality; those are only the fundamentals.
                All the designers we met had their own design practice. Their
                work reflected their personal design philosophies.
              </p>
              </br>
              <p>
                The form we craft and the problems we solve varies depending on
                the context and the people we design for. Our job, as designers,
                is to share our unique interpretation of the world to creatively
                solve problems within the given context. Isn’t it this designer’s
                <i>interpretation</i> that makes the work we do exciting and meaningful?

                Design begins with making sense from the ambiguity and reading between
                the lines of what people say they want, and what they really need.
                For this project, I noticed that there wasn't much intention behind the
                film orders in the previous sites, so the challenge was: How strategic and
                meticulous can we be with the given content without breaking the
                existing architecture? To do so, I aimed to introduce a radical element
                within the Home page to spark curiosity and convey the importance
                of thinking beyond the template.

  						<h3>Mood Board</h3>
  						<p>The process began with gathering a mood board as the team
                shared inspirations and explored different possibilities.
                The mood board consisted of visual inspirations, mockups of
                potential form, approaches to the content organization,
                and potential interactions. This helped us get a sense of
                what everybody had in mind and got the team on the same page.
              </p>
              </br>
              <p>We then condensed the mood board into different approaches that
                we could possibly pursue. The design team split into each of
                these approaches and created mockups of the home page.

                By grouping and ordering the films with intention, we implied a
                linear narrative while providing multiple starting points for
                people who aren’t familiar with the content. Grouping the films
                and giving each category a title was our attempt to evoke curiosity

                This is the iteration prior to the final design of the Home page.
                As you can see in the previous iterations, when creating mockups for
                the home page, I had aimed to contain all the information on the
                landing screen to remove the friction of scrolling. Though I
                realized this was simply a false constraint that limited our
                opportunity to challenge people’s expectations.

                It’s important to reduce friction to achieve an intuitive user

                through interactions. This emotional impact is what resonates with
                people and influences them to revisit the page, as a collection of
                positive interactions grow into a memorable experience.

                With the content strategy in mind, we also wanted to explicitly
                communicate what the Field School site is about. Many people in the
                community who haven’t experienced Field School struggle to understand
                the true value of committing 8-months to the Field School program. Past sites
                emphasize the team aspect more than the films that contain
                the experience and learnings, and these sites have represented Field School
                in their own unique ways, though we wanted to be clear about our intention.
                This concept is also portrayed on the <a href="http://2018.sfuitaliadesign.com/credits"
                target="_blank">Credits page</a>, in which our

                chose to showcase the architectural landscapes and create contrast
                with how the designers were being represented.

                With this perception in mind, I wanted to directly apply the concept
                of Ambiguity by making the landing screen itself ambiguous at first.
                Though as people scroll down the page, more information is revealed
                and will begin to understand the site in a linear order.

                By boldly increasing the size of the copy and creating a void on the
                landing screen, people were required to scroll down to read the
                entire description. I operated under the assumption that people will
                scroll, and that requiring an interaction with the page would
                increase the likelihood of people taking the time to read the copy
                while creating visual impact. After user-testing, all of our
                participants scrolled after seeing the landing screen, and was fully
                engaged with the copy.

                The visual impact of the designer portraits were powerful so we wanted
                to leverage these portraits and introduce a nice surprise on hover.
                This is where the experience lies. We saw this section of the site
                as an opportunity to entice people to dig deeper into the site.

              </br>
              <p>
                To boost the visual impact, we took a specific typographic approach
                that doesn’t distract away from the portraits while revealing information
                that evoke people’s curiosity. In the form of 3 anchors, we revealed
                the Volume description and the film title that hinted what the film
                is about. For films that contain multiple designers, we added a circular
                timer with the portraits to automatically swift through the portraits
                every 3 seconds.

                The intention behind the interaction design was to establish a slower
                pace for the audience. This pacing was first established by people
                scrolling down the large copy, and then the slow entrance of the
                portraits in the film series section. At first, there were no transitions,
                though by creating a fade-in transition from the side, the interaction
                became more dynamic and prevented people from quickly hover down
                the list. Because the portraits were part of the visual narrative,
                we wanted people to take the time to enjoy each portrait.

                My contribution to the designer page aside from development was
                the visual/interaction design of the video player and providing insight
                on the ‘Beyond the Film’ section from a design/development perspective.
                I was also given the opportunity to create the title sequence for the films.

                We wanted the films to be the first piece of content people engage

                learnings were encapsulated in these films. Because our films were
                designer-focused, we saw value in including the remaining content,
                the designers’ projects, underneath the films as extended content
                for people to visually see how these designers apply their design
                philosophy onto their projects; hence ‘Beyond the Film’.

                Though through user testing, we noticed that the interactions we
                implemented weren’t working as well as we had anticipated. We
                experimented with click/hover in order to reveal the quotes related
                to the project, since we didn’t want to overwhelm people by presenting
                too much information in one view. Though majority of our user testers
                either didn’t bother to click or was caught off guard when the cursor
                naturally hovered over the image while scrolling.

                Based on these findings, we scrapped the initial interactions and
                replaced it with a full-page vertical carousel. With this approach,
                we were able to imply a linear narrative through the projects while
                presenting necessary information one-by-one. Though instead of
                immediately showcasing projects and quotes, we provided an overview
                of the section first to let people follow the narrative as they
                interact with the page.

                The problem with the click/hover interaction was solved by presenting the quotes
                and graphics together so people have visual cues while they read. One of the feedbacks
                we got from multiple user testers was that they wished they were able to multi-task
                and briefly skim through the content rather than having to interact with each image.
              </p>
              </br>
              <p>
                After evaluating the test results, we chose to respond to this by creating
                real estate for the quotes without distracting away from the image. By
                doing so, people were given visual cues while they read the quotes.
                We included multiple quotes per image with the use of anchors within anchors
                for sections with multiple key insights. From a content perspective, this approach
                afforded a more engaging experience, as we were able to present one
                project/quote per view and guide people through the designers’ work
                in a linear order that wasn’t imposed since they also have the option
                to skip by navigating through the anchors.

                section that showed one key quote that acted as the threshold to
                transition to the next designer. These quotes allowed us to hint
                the purpose behind the grouping of each Volume while conveying the

              <h3>Mobile Design: Home Page</h3>
              <p>
                This is the mobile design of the Home page. With the left aligned
                typography and the use of full bleed portraits, the site was able
                to translate seamlessly on mobile. The biggest challenge for the
                mobile design was translating hover interaction into touch interaction.
                How could we reveal the portraits when people tap on the names?
                What information could we remove on mobile?

            <div class="copy">
              <p>
                The initial approach was that people could see the portraits when
                they hold on the names and will be taken to the designer page once
                they released their finger. Though after user testing this interaction,
                we learned that people aren’t expecting a portrait to pop up, the
                likelihood of people holding on the names were low. Therefore, we
                chose to make it a double-tap in which the first tap reveals the portrait
                and the second tap sends them to the designer page.

              <p>
                This is the mobile design of the Designer page. In the earlier version,
                we had placed the anchors horizontally at the top, though
                after user testing, we realized this layout implied a horizontall swipe
                when the actual interaction is vertical. Thus we placed the
                anchors vertically on the side, which made the navigation clear while
                creating more space for the content.

            <p>
              Wow... that was fun... I continue to digest what I learned over time,
              as everything I exprienced within that 8-months dissolved into my memory
              as an archive of life lessons, gradually sharing each insight through
              my interpretation of the world.

              <i>“The reason for design is actually 'why design?' Well there's lots
                of reasons why... how it can help and make things better, but I think
                the most core reason of why design is 'because'. Because I want it
                to be. So just kind of that point of conviction is where good things happen.”</i>
